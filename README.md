# Zomato_review_Analysis
## Overview

### The Zomato Review Analysis project aims to analyze customer reviews on Zomato to gain insights into customer sentiments, identify key trends, and extract meaningful information. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Features

### Data Collection: Extracts reviews from Zomato (or uses a pre-existing dataset).

### Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the review text (removal of stopwords, punctuation, tokenization, etc.).

### Sentiment Analysis: Classifies reviews using NLP techniques.

### Visualization: Generates charts and word clouds to understand sentiment distribution.

### Model Training: Implements machine learning models to predict sentiments.

# Technologies Used

### Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Scikit-learn)

### Jupyter Notebook (for development and analysis)

### Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.)

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

# Usage

### Load and preprocess the dataset.

### Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends.

### Train machine learning models for sentiment classification.

### Visualize the results using word clouds and graphs.

### Interpret insights to enhance business strategies.

# Future Enhancements

### Implement deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.

### Automate data extraction from Zomato using web scraping.

### Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
